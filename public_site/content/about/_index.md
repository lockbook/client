# Secure
All user generated content is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">encrypted</a> on clients with keys that never leave your hands.
No Lockbook employee, cloud provider, or state actor can view your content.

# Minimal

Clear, snappy, native user interfaces. Deep support for offline use and background sync.
Our clients include a CLI which requires no dependencies, and invokes your favorite text editor.
Minimal software is secure software.


# Private

No verification, no emails, no passwords.
Our business model is straightforward ($/byte) and doesn't include selling your data.


# Open Source

Secure software [cannot be closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) source. This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.
Open source makes it easy for security researchers to inspect our code and provide feedback.
Problems are discussed [openly](https://github.com/lockbook/lockbook/issues) and [anyone](https://github.com/lockbook/lockbook/pulls) can improve our software.

# Everywhere

Native support for: Linux, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, Android, and Windows.
We capture the essence of each device / platform.
This means a scriptable cli on linux, and Apple Pencil support for our iPad app.
